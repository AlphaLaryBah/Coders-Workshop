###Design an API that will keep track of servers

* When a new Server is added, a request with the type of server is received.
The response will be the type plus a number e.g. Request: API, Response: API-1

* A request for all servers would return a list e.g. API-3, API-4, WEB-1

* A server can be deleted. The request would specify the type and number e.g. API-4
