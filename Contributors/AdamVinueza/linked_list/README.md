# Linked Lists

This is a Python implementation of a doubly-linked list that has a tail as well
as a head node. A nice thing is that you can iterate through it, which greatly
simplifies reversing a list.

Reversing and rotating is possible.

All the methods on the linked list change its state. Perhaps in a future
iteration I'll add a functional linked list--i.e., one that, while not strictly
immutable, nevertheless has no state-changing methods.

There's a simple test runner and some test data.
