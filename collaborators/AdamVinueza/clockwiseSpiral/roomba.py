class Roomba(object):
    '''
    A traverser of multidimensional arrays, for the moment hard-coded
    to traverse in a clockwise spiral.

    Adding a start coordinate and a direction to the constructor, and
    modifying the Direction enumeration so that there are clockwise and
    counterclockwise orderings should make it possible for the Roomba to
    traverse counter-clockwise from arbitrary points in the matrix.

    Roomba instances work as follows. Given a matrix, a floor plan is
    constructed using an instance of MonitorableGrid, which transforms
    a matrix of integers into a matrix of Cell objects, each of which
    contains the integer value as a value and a boolean flag indicating
    whether the Cell has been visited. To traverse the floor plan, Roomba
    employs the following operations:

    - move: recursively follows a path, changing direction as necessary,
      until it must stop.
    - change_direction: uses the direction package's built-in generator to
      retrieve the next (clockwise) Direction, then returns the next
      location given that Direction.
    - must_turn: returns True if the next location in the current direction
      is either off the end of the matrix or a Cell that has been visited.
    - mark: sets the currently occupied Cell as visited.
    
    The traversal algorithm is simple: the instance will move until it must
    turn, then it will change Direction in a clockwise fashion and continue
    moving until it can't move any longer. Along the way it will mark each
    Cell as visited and store its value in a breadcrumb trail. When it can't
    move any longer (effectively, when it must turn immediately after it has
    changed Direction), the move operation returns.
