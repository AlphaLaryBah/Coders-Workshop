1st day, idea behind language-agnosticism, paired-programming
Do `fizz-buzz` in a language you don't know

- Tactics vs strategy: strategy person knows how to solve algorithm, tactics person knows the language

### Recursion

- `factorial`
- `max_rot`
  - Show a solution not using recursion, then one with

> Andy's Notes: We received good feedback. It seems most people were sufficiently challenged. I'm considering revisiting the problems faced and helping them achieve clarity. Perhaps moving forward with different challenges is ill conceived if fellow coders are still working through last session's problem set. If they're still fighting in that space, they have much to gain right where they are, before running to another topic. For next week I may focus on Functions & Execution Context. This is a smooth entry point (IMHO) for coders to develop they're technical communication, which inturn supports better pseudo-coding, problem modeling and so forth.

> Supplemental: Adam V. suggested a code review process, which I :heart:. I think we can find a way to evaluate & critique one each other's work, perhaps capture it in a group repo and then build towards work-flow skills?

## future topics

### How to approach algorithms

- Listen, example, brute force, optimize, walk through, implement, test

- Big O notation
  - runtime -- time & space complexity
  - For example, Nested for-loops: _Is there simpler solution?_
  - Encourage use of benchmarking
  - Space complexity uses RAM -- Recursion a solution or problem?

### ES2017 stuff

- e.g merge sort

- Data structures
	-	Map, BST (these are helpful structures for common algorithms)

  - Bit manipulation/bitwise operators

  - Hash table, return number appearing an odd number of times

### Static vs dynamic typing

### Testing answers

- Creating simple tests, creating automated unit tests

- Thinking in character codes
	- Often helpful to convert characters to their code value
		UNICODE vs. ASCII


### Borrowing ideas from Java, Python, C++, JS

- e.g. in Java, often you create arrays with a certain length. This is helpful for
some algorithms, but not an approach one might consider in JS (find first dupe).


### Pro Pseudocode

- Importance of pseudocode (importance of it when asked to do it)

- Don't write comments to describe code, write code to describe comments

### Version Control

- Git → Adam wants to do Coders’ Workshop repo

  - Reset head, revert

### Asynchronous

### Multiple pointers

- reverse array in place, etc

### Using RegEx
- can be very helpful for coders outside of solving algorithms, e.g. refactoring code
- can also make quick work of some algorithms, e.g. Andy's solution to parens problem

### Algorithms/problems

- Sort into easy, medium, hard, expert
- Ideally have a few skill levels for each topic
