## Problem

[Clockwise Spiral](https://github.com/andy-young/Coders-Workshop/blob/master/Coding-Challenges/clockwiseSpiral/clockwiseSpiral.md)

### Bonus
Implement the above problem by creating a class with the following methods:<br>
`next(): returns the next element in the clockwise spiral`<br>
`has_next(): returns a boolean indicating whether there are further elements to display in the multidimensional array`
