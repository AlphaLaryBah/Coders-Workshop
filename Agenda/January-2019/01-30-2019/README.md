## Challenge 2: Day Trader

> Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

```javascript
Input: [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]
Output: 5
// Because you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.
```
