# Welcome to Coder's Workshop!

>A MeetupÂ© where programmers can develop problem solving skills & improve their technical communication.

The format is simple:

1. We start with a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) related to the technical challenge we'll be working on.

1. We introduce the problem.

    - We present 3 difficultly versions of "_the problem_" for you to choose from.
    - If you pick level 1, get with another person who picked level one, or not. There's no wrong way to move forward. Mix it up! :cocktail:

1. Enter problem solving mode:

    - **Phase 1:** TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION

        - Communicate out the problem with your partner, and feel free to chat with other groups as well!
        - Determine what programming language you want to use.
        - Use *white boards* or paper & markers to _pseudo-code_ your way to a solution.

    - **Phase 2:** [PAIR-PROGRAMMING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

        - Using a single machine, one person _navigates_ or talks out what to code.
        - The _driver_ (person on machine) will listen to the navigator and manually code the algorithm.

1. Wrap-Up:

    - **7:45pm**

        - Share thoughts on what you learned
        - Clean-up your space
        - Parting Announcements
