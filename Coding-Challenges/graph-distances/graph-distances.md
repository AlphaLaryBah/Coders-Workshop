# Graph Distances

Using the provided graph structure and breadth-first search function provided, modify the BFS to return an object/dict containing each vertex and its distance to the start vertex.  
Start by populating the graph with vertices and edges: addVertex(); addEdge()

The graph 
C
|  
A-B-E  
|  
D

Should return { A: 0, B: 1, C: 1, D: 1, E: 2 }
