# Rotate a linked List

Implement a method that will rotate the linked list to the right by _k_ places. The method should take one parameter, _k_.

For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and _k_ = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7.

Given the linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and _k_ = 3, it should become 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2.
