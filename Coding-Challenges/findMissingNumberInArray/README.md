# Find Missing Number in Array

Assume you're given an array with every number in some range from 1 to N, except that it's missing one number. E.g. `[2, 1, 3, 5]`. Write a function that takes this array and returns the missing number.

For example, given
`[8, 4, 6, 5, 2, 3, 1, 9]`

Your function should return `7`.
