# Longest Continuous Vowels

Given an array of strings, sort the array in descending order based on the number of continuous vowels in each string.

For example, given `['Or is it the taco that makes the chili spicy', 'Closer the neighbor, further the anger', 'The anxious queen will surrender']`

Your function should return `['The anxious queen will surrender', 'Closer the neighbor, further the anger', 'Or is it the taco that makes the chili spicy']`

Since the first sentence in the returned array has at most 3 consecutive vowels (both `iou` and `uee`), the second has two (`ei`), and the third has at most one consecutive vowel.

Only consider standard vowels `a, e, i, o, u`. Case is unimportant.
