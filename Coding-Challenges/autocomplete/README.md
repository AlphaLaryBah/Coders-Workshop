# Autocomplete

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string `s` and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have `s` as a prefix.

For example, given the query string `de` and the set of strings `[dog, deer, deal]`, return `[deer, deal]`.

As a follow-up, implement a configuration called `loose` that returns all strings that include the letters contained in `s` in any location, however in order.

For example, given the query string `de` and the set of strings `[dog, deer, drier, edit ]`, return `[deer, drier]`
