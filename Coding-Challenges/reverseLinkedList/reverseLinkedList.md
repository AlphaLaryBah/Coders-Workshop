# Reverse a linked list

Given a linked list, return the list printed in reverse.

For example, given the list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
return 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Hint: modify the singly linked list to make it doubly linked. Then think about reversing a list: what happens to each node's `previous` and `next` references?
