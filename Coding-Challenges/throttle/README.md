# Throttle

Implement a throttle function to limit the number of function calls in 2 seconds.

For example, if a function is called 10 times in 2 seconds, it should run only once, and other calls during that period should be ignored. If that function is called again after the 2 second period, it should run again.

A function should never be executed more than once per every 2 seconds.
