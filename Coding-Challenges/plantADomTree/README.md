# Plant a DOM Tree

This is an open-ended challenge. The goal is to build an interface for creating and working with a DOM tree. How it is implemented and what properties/methods are exposed are up for debate. However, as a baseline, it should expose methods to add/remove elements from the tree and change certain properties.

A final challenge would be to have a method on the tree that returns HTML that can be parsed and rendered by a browser.
