# Hex To RGB

Create a function that takes a string representing a hex color value and convert it to its corresponding RGB value, returned in an object.

For example, given "#FF9933" your function should return `{ r: 255, g: 153, b: 51 }`.

You can expect the input will always be a string, and will always be comprised of valid hex digits.
