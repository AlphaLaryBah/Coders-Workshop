# Reverse Every Other Word In String

Write a function to reverse every other word in a string. For reference, the first word should not be reversed, the second should be.

For example, given `reverse this string`, your function should return `reverse siht string`. Given `Drink more coffee, if you would`, return `Drink erom coffee, fi you dluow`.

You may consider punctuation part of the word. So given `Hi there, you don't have a nametag`, return `Hi ,ereht you t'nod have a nametag`
