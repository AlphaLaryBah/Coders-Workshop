* pair programming
* tactics vs strategy
  * strategy person knows how to solve algorithm, tactics person knows the language

## Challenges :muscle:

### FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Try it in a language you don't know!
